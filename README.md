## What is YogaMate?
YogaMate is an AI-powered Yoga Fitness App designed to address the challenges of loneliness and fitness in the post-COVID era. It combines personalized yoga plans generated by OpenAI's API with the support of an AI companion to guide users through their fitness journey. It also uses Eleven Labs API to generate audio from the text input that its given to give some personality to our AI Mascot, Luna. By offering tailored yoga sessions and constant encouragement, YogaMate aims to improve both physical and mental well-being while fostering a sense of connection and motivation.

## Why did we make YogaMate?
The post-COVID era is plagued with increased loneliness due to social isolation and declining fitness levels stemming from reduced physical activity and unhealthy lifestyles.
- Fitness: Physical inactivity surged, impacting overall health.
